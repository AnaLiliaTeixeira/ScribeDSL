Install a new copy of Eclipse by following the instructions below. 
Multiple instances of Eclipse in different versions can happily co-exist in your system. 
We recommend that you do not customize any existing installations of Eclipse on your PC. 
You would likely break the setup for your existing projects (if you already use Eclipse), and 
likely the resulting installation would be slightly incomplete, leading to incompatibilities 
(you do not want to waste time on them).
